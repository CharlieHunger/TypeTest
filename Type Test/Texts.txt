The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud.
Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
